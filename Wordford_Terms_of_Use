# Wordford Terms of Use

_Last updated: November 11, 2025_

Welcome to Wordford ("we", "our", or "us"). These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Wordford mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By downloading, installing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to create an account. By using the Service, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the authority to enter into these Terms.

## 2. Account Registration
- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities under your account.
- Notify us promptly if you believe your account has been compromised.
- We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any violation of these Terms or misuse of the Service.

## 3. License and Acceptable Use
We grant you a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes. You agree not to:
- Copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of the Service without permission.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to obtain source code except as permitted by law.
- Circumvent security features or improperly access restricted areas.
- Upload malicious code, spam, or content that is unlawful, abusive, or infringes third-party rights.
- Use the Service to harass, impersonate, or mislead others.

## 4. Content and Intellectual Property
All text, graphics, logos, sounds, and software are owned by Wordford or its licensors and protected by intellectual property laws. You retain ownership of content you submit (e.g., feedback or custom notes) but grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, and analyze that content to operate and improve the Service.

## 5. Premium Subscriptions
- Wordford Premium provides additional features and benefits as described in-app.
- Purchases and trials are managed by the app store and RevenueCat. Payment terms, renewal schedules, and price details are displayed before checkout.
- Trials may convert to paid subscriptions unless cancelled before the trial ends. Trial eligibility may vary by plan and user history.
- You can manage or cancel subscriptions through your app store account settings. Refund requests must be handled by the app store provider unless otherwise required by law.

## 6. Virtual Rewards and Credits
The Service may grant in-app credits, energy, or other rewards. These have no real-world monetary value, are non-transferable, and may be modified or discontinued at our discretion.

## 7. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms, misuse the Service, or if we discontinue the Service. Upon termination, rights granted to you under these Terms will cease, and certain sections (e.g., disclaimers, liability limitations) will continue to apply.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. We disclaim all implied warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted, secure, or error-free service, and your use is at your own risk.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent allowed by law, Wordford and its affiliates are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability for any claim is limited to the amount you paid (if any) for the Service during the twelve months preceding the claim.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so these exclusions may not apply to you. Nothing in these Terms limits liability for fraud, willful misconduct, or injury caused by negligence where such limitation is prohibited by law.

## 10. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold Wordford, its affiliates, and employees harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses arising out of your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.

## 11. Changes to the Service and Terms
We may modify or discontinue features at any time. We may update these Terms to reflect product changes or legal requirements. We will update the "Last updated" date and may provide in-app notice. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 12. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of Türkiye, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Disputes will be resolved in the competent courts of Istanbul, Türkiye, unless mandatory law requires otherwise.
