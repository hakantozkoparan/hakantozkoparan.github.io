# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 19, 2026

**IBAN Cepte** built the **IBAN Cepte** app as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by **IBAN Cepte** at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

### 1. Information Collection and Use

**Local Data Storage**
The primary function of IBAN Cepte is to store your IBANs and Credit Card information. **We do not store this data on our servers.** All financial data, IBANs, and card details you enter are stored locally on your device using your device's secure storage mechanisms. We do not have access to this data.

**Third Party Services**
While we do not collect your personal data directly, the app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you, primarily for analytics and advertising purposes.

### 2. Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

### 3. Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

### 4. Service Providers

We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

*   To facilitate our Service;
*   To provide the Service on our behalf;
*   To perform Service-related services; or
*   To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information (e.g., Ad identifiers). The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

### 5. Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Note:** Since IBAN Cepte works offline for its core features and stores data locally, your financial data is as secure as your physical device. We strongly recommend using device security features (PIN, FaceID, etc.) to protect your phone.

### 6. Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do the necessary actions.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
