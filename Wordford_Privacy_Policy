# Wordford Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 11, 2025_

Wordford ("we", "our", or "us") provides a mobile application designed to help users practice vocabulary in a personalized way (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect personal information when you use the Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account Information
- Email address and display name when you register or sign in.
- Authentication metadata and identifiers provided by the sign-in provider (e.g., Firebase Auth).

### 1.2 Usage Data
- Interactions with lessons, levels, rewards, and in-app events.
- Device information such as operating system, language, and app version.
- Crash reports and performance metrics (collected via Expo/Firebase tooling) to diagnose issues.

### 1.3 Subscription and Purchase Data
- RevenueCat subscriber identifiers and transaction receipts for validating premium access.
- Trial eligibility state and subscription status (active, expired, or cancelled).

### 1.4 Optional Communications
- Messages you send via contact forms or support requests.
- Feedback submissions, survey responses, or beta program information.

We do **not** collect biometric, precise location, or payment card data directly. Purchases are processed by the app store and RevenueCat on our behalf.

## 2. How We Use Information
We process personal information in order to:
- Authenticate users and maintain their progress across devices.
- Provide core gameplay features, award rewards, and manage streaks.
- Offer and manage premium subscriptions, including free trials and renewals.
- Respond to support requests, bug reports, or user inquiries.
- Improve performance, reliability, and content quality.
- Send optional notifications about updates, events, or reminders (where consented).

## 3. How We Share Information
We do not sell personal data. We share information only with:
- **Service Providers:** Firebase, RevenueCat, Expo, and analytics tools that enable authentication, storage, push notifications, crash reporting, and subscription validation.
- **Legal Authorities:** If required to comply with law, enforce our terms, or protect rights, safety, or property.

Each provider processes information according to their own privacy policies and industry-standard safeguards.

## 4. Data Retention
We retain personal information for as long as you maintain an account or as needed to provide the Service. If you request deletion, we will remove or anonymize data within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required for legal or legitimate business purposes (e.g., preventing fraud or accounting obligations).

## 5. Your Choices and Rights
- **Access & Update:** You may review and update profile details within the app or by contacting us.
- **Email Preferences:** Opt out of optional communications via in-app controls or unsubscribe links.
- **Push Notifications:** Manage permissions in your device settings.
- **Account Deletion:** Contact us to delete your account and associated data.

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have additional rights related to data portability, objection, or restriction of processing. Submit requests via our contact form or the support email below.

## 6. Security Measures
We apply administrative, technical, and organizational measures to safeguard personal data, including encrypted connections, access controls, and regular security reviews. However, no system is perfectly secure; please use strong passwords and keep your device protected.

## 7. International Transfers
Our infrastructure may process data in countries other than your own. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to countries that may have different privacy laws. We rely on contractual safeguards and provider compliance programs to protect data during such transfers.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, please contact us so we can delete it promptly.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features, legal requirements, or best practices. We will revise the "Last updated" date and, where appropriate, provide in-app notices. Continued use after any update constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

## 10. Contact Us
If you have questions or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
